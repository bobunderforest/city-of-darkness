        When I was a boy, the desire to explore Kowloon never left me for a
        minute. I wandered through the dark corners of the city, but no matter
        how confused I got, I somehow always found my way back home. My greatest
        pleasure was walking on the rooftops, because they were a place where my
        friends and I could play. We would jump on the mattresses that people
        threw out of their apartments and pretend that they were trampolines. We
        knew that the airport was a 10-minute walk away. When the planes flew
        over us, we could clearly see the people in them, who, in turn, could
        see us clearly through the portholes. But we didn't realize how
        dangerous it was to play on the roof, and we let kites fly into the sky,
        sometimes even while another plane was flying right over our heads. It
        was a breathtaking sight!

        We moved to Kowloon when my eldest daughter was one year old. Our
        neighbors from Guangzhou also moved there. We chose this place because
        the housing was cheap. When my children grew up, my husband lost his
        job, and we just started making dim sum and selling them. We all woke up
        every day at 5 a.m. My husband made the buns, and the kids helped make
        the buns. We steamed them, and as soon as they were ripe, we took them
        out onto the street and sold them. We had a wooden cart, the kind
        vendors use, and inside it was an oven, which kept the baked goods warm.
        Dim sum tastes better when hot, right?

        Kowloon was like a labyrinth to me. I would leave work, take a
        flashlight, and walk through its nooks and crannies, measuring
        everything with a ruler. I never knew what might happen: sometimes a
        stream of water would fall on me from above. It was like an underground
        exploration. In some places it was pitch dark, and even with a
        flashlight in my hands, I felt uneasy. If I suddenly heard a rustling
        sound or a loud noise, I would immediately run away in fear. Dogs chased
        me. I was yelled at and sworn at by locals. It became especially
        difficult to visit Kowloon after the information about the demolition
        was made public, because its inhabitants were at their limit. They did
        not know who we were, and did not want to share any information, did not
        allow anyone to enter their homes. At that time, when I lived there, I
        only moved around on the roof, that is, to get to the destination, you
        did not need to go down! The roofs had their own markings, roads. I
        called it the Kowloon Highway.

        Kowloon was good for three things: crack dens, brothels, and unlicensed
        dentists. My father moved to Kowloon from mainland China and built a
        small shop right in our Kowloon apartment. He divided it into two parts
        â€” the work area of the shop and the bedroom behind the wall. I often
        helped my father with the shop, working as a salesman. The shop, in
        addition to household goods and food, also sold drug paraphernalia. Shop
        visitors often offered me to try it myself, but I held back. At some
        point I finally tried it and couldn't stop.

        When I wasn't studying or playing, I had to take care of my brothers and
        sisters, and I took on this chores to help my parents. Our family made
        and sold fish balls. My father got up every day at 4 a.m. to go to the
        market and prepare all the ingredients. I was assigned to mold the
        balls, and I did it very quickly. Fishball-making competitions were
        often shown on TV, and I could make them even faster than the winners of
        those shows. In a minute, I could make more than 100 fishballs.
        Sometimes our friends and neighbors would crowd around our house just to
        watch this process.

        My mentor told me that it usually took him a month to prepare a student
        for work. At that time, I was very hungry for knowledge, and it took me
        only two weeks. Even during dinner, I thought about street and house
        numbers. Sometimes, while taking a shower, I would sing: "2, 6, 9, and
        after 9 comes 3, then comes 32, and after that comes 32, 11 and 12." I
        kept mumbling something about numbers. The main difficulty was that many
        of the houses didn't even have numbers. Kowloon was the only place that
        shocked me in my years as a postman. Postmen rarely experience shock in
        their profession.

        The letter boxes were made of steel, and there were a lot of electric
        wires on top. I hardly knew that one of the wires was touching the metal
        box. And at the moment when I was throwing in the letter, I was
        electrocuted. Since I left this place, I have never seen such huge rats
        in Hong Kong. But for Kowloon, this was a common sight. The rats were
        the size of cats. Their bellies dragged on the ground. I have never seen
        such horror anywhere else!
