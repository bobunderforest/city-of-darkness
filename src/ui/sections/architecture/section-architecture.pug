      |Kowloon was far from the only place on Earth where poverty and lawlessness reigned.
      |But it was the only one with such architecture and appearance.
      |The main reason was the rapid population growth. In 10 years the city&amp;s population could double.

          |This city could not grow in length and width, because the territory that belonged to it was limited to two and a half hectares.

          |It could not grow in depth because the foundations of the buildings already built everywhere were not designed for this.

          |Growing tall was also impossible: the height of buildings was limited to 14 floors due to the fact that there was an airport nearby, and planes landed directly over Kowloon.

          |So there was nothing left to do but grow within itself.

    .content-wrapper__text
      |And so it turned out that the houses, like liquid, filled all the space allocated for them.
      |Illegal buildings grew like mushrooms after rain, the gaps between the houses gradually
      |decreased, and eventually it all turned into one big and ugly house, a kind of
      |self-regulating, albeit toxic, ecosystem.

    .content-wrapper__title Without a plan
    .content-wrapper__text
      |You can pile up in different ways. All the chaos and absurdity of the buildings was due
      |to the lack of a unified architectural plan for the city. At the dawn of its development,
      |the city consisted of two- and three-story houses built on the ruins of a military fortress.
      |Surprisingly, no one was going to demolish them, and they served as the foundation for
      |further piling up. At first, the city's residents built everything themselves, with their
      |own hands, as best they could.

      |Then small Hong Kong construction companies joined this process.
      |They realized that in order to build something in Kowloon, you donâ€™t need to get
      |permits or pay taxes. But the demand for housing grew exponentially. They paid a
      |little extra to the owners of already built houses for the opportunity to add a
      |few floors, and 10-square-meter apartments costing 10 thousand dollars were flying
      |off the shelves like hot cakes. Sometimes 7-8 people lived in such small apartments.
      |Of course, such construction took place in violation of all possible architectural norms.

    .content-wrapper__text
      |Courtyards and playgrounds ceased to exist in this city almost immediately, and the
      |streets became narrower and narrower, sometimes reaching only 70 cm in width. Apartments
      |either had no windows at all, or the windows offered a picturesque where you could sometimes
      |reach out and touch the opposite house. At some point, the streets became so crowded that
      |a parallel overground system of passages appeared in the city.
